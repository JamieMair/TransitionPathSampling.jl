# Dynamics

Currently, this package assumes that the trajectory is discrete in time, and has a fixed number of points. In the future, this package may be extended to include continuous-time processes as well.

## Random Walk Dynamics

A common underlying dynamics for trajectories that are discrete in time, but continuous in space, is the random walk dynamics. These are common as they have nice ergodic properties and are simple to generate samples from. One can think of these dynamics as exploring the state space.
